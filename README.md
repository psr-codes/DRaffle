# D-Raffle 
A **decentralized** lottery system built on the **Aptos blockchain,** where users can purchase tickets using APT tokens for a chance to win a prize. The lottery is managed by an admin who can initiate the lottery and select winners.

# Major Problems with Traditional Lottery Companies:
1. Lack of Transparency
2. Centralized Control
3. Delayed Payouts:
4. High Operational Costs:


# Features of D-Raffle and how it solves above issues:
Being blockchain based DRaffle solves these 4 issue besides having these features.
1. Customizable ticket price and prize pool setup during lottery initialization
2. Purchase tickets with APT tokens
3. Random winner selection based on the timestamp
4. Admin-controlled lottery operations
5. View functions to check lottery status and details
6. Automatic prize distribution to the winners

# Future Plans
1. Migrating to mainnet
2. Implementing automatic winner selection after certain duration without any human interaction.
3. Implementing several lottery modes like, the prize amout being dynamic (like sum of total ticket collections) and others

# Revenue Model: ($4 Billion - $40 Billion Anually)
I'm going to write a long para on this so hold tight judges. 
*[The global lottery market size was USD 346.26 billion in 2023 and market is projected to touch USD 504.196 billion by 2032](https://www.businessresearchinsights.com/market-reports/lottery-market-100506)*

Lottery market is huge and most of these transactions are being carried out with physical money (including online bank payments). Now with our new blockchain based implementaion, instead of distributing 100% of the collected amount by tickets, we can distribute only 80%-90%. This way 20% of all transaction amount is ** Pure Earning**

Now let say we could capture 1% if this huge $350 billion market. Meaning people start spending $3.5 billion on crypto lotteries and raffles annually. Now let say we keep 10% of this amout and distribute the 90% to winner(s). This would make us **$350 Million Annually** 

Off course all these big number are not going to be reality with just my app. But I'm proposing an Idea which has potential to change this multi trillion dollar crypto market.
